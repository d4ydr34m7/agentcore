# AgentCore – Vision

I’m building this project to learn how to create a custom AI agent using AWS AgentCore.  
The goal is to make an agent that can understand simple questions, fetch the right data, and give clear answers.  

This will start small — just one working agent and a basic setup — and I’ll keep improving it step by step as I learn more.
